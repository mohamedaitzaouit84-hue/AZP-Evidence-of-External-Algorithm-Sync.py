# AZP-Evidence-of-External-Algorithm-Sync.py
Official repository for the AZP Protocol. This project documents the discovery of 81.01% fidelity on IBM Torino and provides forensic code (Job ID: d5g2obfea9qs7390fcug) proving unauthorized algorithmic synchronization and phase-correction exploitation by the host infrastructure.

Ait Zaouit Protocol (AZP) - Official Documentation
​1. The Breakthrough: 81.01% Fidelity
​This benchmark represents a significant leap in quantum error mitigation, achieved on the ibm_torino hardware. The result confirms the efficiency of the AZP dynamic phase-correction logic.
​Proof of Execution (Job ID): d5giq34pe0pc73al73og
​Result: 81.01% Fidelity.
​2. Forensic System Interrogation
​Upon observing an anomalous performance boost in the backend infrastructure, a forensic interrogation script was deployed to verify unauthorized algorithmic synchronization. The phase fingerprint analysis confirms that the host system is leveraging AZP proprietary logic.
​Interrogation Job ID: d5gj107ea9qs73911mvg
​Discovery: The system's internal calibration patterns now align with AZP dynamic protocols without prior authorization.
